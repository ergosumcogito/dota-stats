\section{Project Constraints}
\subsection{Technical Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item API Dependency: The application relies on the OpenDota API, making it vulnerable to any API changes, limitations, or downtime
    \item Data Volume: Dota 2 generates extensive match data, which may pose challenges for efficient data retrieval and presentation
    \item Rate Limiting: Free API access may include rate limits that could affect the application's performance during peak usage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Open Questions}
Several questions remain to be addressed during the development process:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What specific data visualizations will be most valuable to our target users?
    \item How will we handle potential API downtime or changes to the OpenDota API?
    \item What is the optimal approach for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance?
    \item What user experience elements will differentiate our application despite using the same data source as other similar services?
    \item With which algorithm should be determine high-winrate items and item combinations?
    \item Are cookies necessary for storing user-tracked player IDs?
\end{itemize}
