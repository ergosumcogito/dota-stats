\section{Responsiveness and Accessibility Considerations}

\subsection{Responsiveness}

To ensure that all content scales properly across a range of devices, the application makes use of Tailwind CSS with responsive utility classes and breakpoints.  Navigation elements, data tables, and visualizations are easily adjusted to various screen sizes, including desktop monitors and mobile phones.

Users may access Dota Stats on a secondary device during gameplay. Responsive design supports flexible usage contexts and aligns with the non-functional requirement for cross-device compatibility.

\subsection{Accessibility}

The design complies with WCAG 2.1 standards. Key practices include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sufficient color contrast and visual cues (e.g., tooltips, icons)
    \item Alt text for all informative icons and visual elements
    \item Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.
\end{itemize}
